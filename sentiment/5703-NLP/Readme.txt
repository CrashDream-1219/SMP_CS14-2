Project Title: S3 Audio/Video Sentiment Analysis Service

ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
This project is a Flask-based web API that performs automatic sentiment analysis on audio or video files stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

The system:
1. Downloads audio/video files from the specified S3 folder.
2. Uses the Whisper model to transcribe audio into text.
3. Performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob to calculate polarity and subjectivity.
4. Generates two bar chart images (for polarity and subjectivity) using matplotlib.
5. Uploads the output images back to a designated folder in the same S3 bucket.
